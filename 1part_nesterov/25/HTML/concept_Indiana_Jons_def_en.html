In 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones overcomes an ancient booby-trapped temple in Peru to retrieve a golden idol. Though betrayed by his guides and cornered by rival archaeologist Ren√© Belloq and an indigenous tribe, Jones escapes in a waiting seaplane; Belloq steals the idol for himself. After returning to America, Jones is approached by two Army Intelligence agents. They reveal Nazis are excavating Tanis, and one of their telegrams mentions Jones's old mentor Abner Ravenwood. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, which Hitler believes will make their army invincible, and the agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark first.
