Star Trek: Nemesis is a 2002 American science-fiction film directed by Stuart Baird. It is the tenth film in the Star Trek film series, as well as the fourth and final film to star the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation. On Romulus, members of the Romulan Senate debate terms of peace and alliance from the Reman rebel leader Shinzon. The Remans are a slave race of the Romulan Empire, used as miners and as cannon fodder. While a faction of the military supports Shinzon, the Praetor and Senate are opposed to an alliance. After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room. Meanwhile, the crew of the USS Enterprise prepare to bid farewell to newly married first officer Commander William Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi. They discover an energy reading on a planet near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Lieutenant Commander Data land on the planet and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data named B-4. The crew deduce it to be an earlier version of Data.
