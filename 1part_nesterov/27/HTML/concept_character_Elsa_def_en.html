Doctor Elsa Schneider was an Austrian art historian and former Olympic swimmer who was recruited by the Nazis to find the Holy Grail in order to acquire immortality for the Third Reich leader Adolf Hitler. Around 1938, Schneider was involved in a scheme with American industrialist Walter Donovan to extract information from professors Henry Walton Jones, Senior and Indiana Jones in order to discover the location of the Grail through the former's Grail Diary. The Joneses eventually realized her true nature and recovered the diary from her at a Berlin bookburning rally.
