William Thomas "Will" Riker was a 24th century male Human Starfleet officer. During his career, a transporter accident resulted in two Rikers, with each one being identical to the other, as well as genetically indistinguishable. Their personalities and memories were the same up to the point of duplication. The other Riker would remain trapped on Nervala IV for eight years without anyone knowing of his exsistance, and, after being rescused, would eventually decided to use his middle name and became known as Thomas Riker.
