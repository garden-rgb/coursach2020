served in the Soviet Army as a military scientist – Joseph Stalin's favorite – and a senior officer up to the rank of Colonel. She was also a KGB agent, a psychic, as well as a very skilled fencer and combatant during the Cold War. Born with apparent psychic powers which led her to be ostracized in her early life, Spalko was consumed with the desire to discover why she was different.
In 1957, as part of her mandate to acquire artifacts with the potential for paranormal military application, Spalko led a team with Siberian Colonel Antonin Dovchenko to find the mysterious Crystal Skull of Akator with which to brainwash and manipulate the minds of American forces, giving the Soviets a tactical advantage in the Cold War.
